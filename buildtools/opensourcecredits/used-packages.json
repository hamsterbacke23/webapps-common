These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4.

It also optionally uses the `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` preset as well as `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`, `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`. Furthermore the preset is adding polyfills.\n\n**Note**: Since `core-js@2` and `core-js@3` are both supported from Babel 7.4.0, we recommend directly adding `core-js` and setting the version via the [`corejs`](#corejs) option.\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3\n\n# or\n\nyarn add --dev core-js@2 @babel/runtime-corejs2\n\n```\n\nUsually, no additional configuration is required. If needed though, there is an option to fine-tune the preset's behavior. Just add the following to `nuxt.config.js`:\n\n```js\nbabel: {\n  presets(env, [ preset, options ]) {\n    return [\n      [ \"@nuxt/babel-preset-app\", options ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`env` is an object which contains `envName` (`server`, `client`, `modern`) and all `nuxtEnv` properties (`isDev`, `isServer`, `isClient`, `isModern`, `isLegacy`)\n\n`preset` is the preset package name `@nuxt/babel-preset-app`\n\n`options` is an object with parameters, for example:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  useBuiltIns: \"entry\"\n}\n```\n\nBelow is a list of all available `options` parameters:\n\n### Options\n\n* **configPath** - [`@babel/preset-env` parameter](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#configpath)\n* **forceAllTransforms** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#forcealltransforms)' parameter\n* **debug**, default  `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#debug)' parameter\n* **decoratorsBeforeExport**\n* **decoratorsLegacy**, default true\n* **exclude** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#exclude)' parameter\n* **ignoreBrowserslistConfig**, defaults to value of `modern` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#ignorebrowserslistconfig)' parameter\n* **include** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#include)' parameter\n* **jsx**, default true, can be a an object passed as params to [@vue/babel-preset-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/babel-preset-jsx)\n* **loose**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#loose)' parameter and also sets `loose=true` for `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`\n* **modules**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules)' parameter\n* **polyfills**, default `core-js@2: ['es6.array.iterator','es6.promise','es6.object.assign','es7.promise.finally']`, `core-js@3: ['es.array.iterator','es.promise','es.object.assign','es.promise.finally']`, more [in the corresponding repository](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)\n* **shippedProposals** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#shippedproposals)' parameter\n* **spec** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#spec)' parameter\n* **targets** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#targets)' parameter\n* **useBuiltIns**, default `\"usage\"` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins)' parameter\n* **corejs**, default `{ version: 2 }` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#corejs)' parameter\n\nThere are [detailed docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#options) for the parameters of '@babel/preset-env'.\n\n### Example 1. Change targets for server and client respectively\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  build: {\n    babel: {\n      presets({ envName }) {\n        const envTargets = {\n          client: { browsers: [\"last 2 versions\"], ie: 11 },\n          server: { node: \"current\" },\n        }\n        return [\n          [\n            \"@nuxt/babel-preset-app\",\n            {\n              targets: envTargets[envName]\n            }\n          ]\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2. Use core-js@3\n\n**NOTE**: Make sure that all dependencies have been upgraded to use core-js@3. If core-js@2 and core-js@3 are both dependent, babel may resolve incorrect core-js package which is hoisted by yarn/npm.\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3\n```\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  build: {\n    babel: {\n      // envName: server, client, modern\n      presets({ envName }) {\n        return [\n          [\n            '@nuxt/babel-preset-app',\n            {\n              corejs: { version: 3 }\n            }\n          ]\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"},{"name":"@nuxt/builder","repository":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js","licenseText":"none"},{"name":"@nuxt/cli","repository":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js","licenseText":"none"},{"name":"@nuxt/config","repository":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js","licenseText":"none"},{"name":"@nuxt/core","repository":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js","licenseText":"none"},{"name":"@nuxt/devalue","repository":"https://github.com/nuxt-community/devalue","licenseText":"Copyright (c) 2018-19 [these people](https://github.com/nuxt/devalue/graphs/contributors)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Since this method is passed to component render functions as the first argument, in most cases you'd do this:\n\n```js\nVue.component('jsx-example', {\n  render(h) {\n    // <-- h must be in scope\n    return <div id=\"foo\">bar</div>\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Difference from React JSX\n\nFirst, Vue 2.0's vnode format is different from React's. The second argument to the `createElement` call is a \"data object\" that accepts nested objects. Each nested object will be then processed by corresponding modules:\n\n```js\nrender (h) {\n  return h('div', {\n    // Component props\n    props: {\n      msg: 'hi'\n    },\n    // Normal HTML attributes\n    attrs: {\n      id: 'foo'\n    },\n    // DOM props\n    domProps: {\n      innerHTML: 'bar'\n    },\n    // Event handlers are nested under \"on\", though\n    // modifiers such as in v-on:keyup.enter are not\n    // supported. You'll have to manually check the\n    // keyCode in the handler instead.\n    on: {\n      click: this.clickHandler\n    },\n    // For components only. Allows you to listen to\n    // native events, rather than events emitted from\n    // the component using vm.$emit.\n    nativeOn: {\n      click: this.nativeClickHandler\n    },\n    // Class is a special module, same API as `v-bind:class`\n    class: {\n      foo: true,\n      bar: false\n    },\n    // Style is also same as `v-bind:style`\n    style: {\n      color: 'red',\n      fontSize: '14px'\n    },\n    // Other special top-level properties\n    key: 'key',\n    ref: 'ref',\n    // Assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for\n    refInFor: true,\n    slot: 'slot'\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe equivalent of the above in Vue 2.0 JSX is:\n\n```jsx\nrender (h) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      // Component props\n      propsMsg=\"hi\"\n      // Normal attributes or component props.\n      id=\"foo\"\n      // DOM properties are prefixed with `domProps`\n      domPropsInnerHTML=\"bar\"\n      // event listeners are prefixed with `on` or `nativeOn`\n      onClick={this.clickHandler}\n      nativeOnClick={this.nativeClickHandler}\n      // other special top-level properties\n      class={{ foo: true, bar: false }}\n      style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '14px' }}\n      key=\"key\"\n      ref=\"ref\"\n      // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for\n      refInFor\n      slot=\"slot\">\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component Tip\n\nIf a custom element starts with lowercase, it will be treated as a string id and used to lookup a registered component. If it starts with uppercase, it will be treated as an identifier, which allows you to do:\n\n```js\nimport Todo from './Todo.js'\n\nexport default {\n  render(h) {\n    return <Todo /> // no need to register Todo via components option\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### JSX Spread\n\nJSX spread is supported, and this plugin will intelligently merge nested data properties. For example:\n\n```jsx\nconst data = {\n  class: ['b', 'c'],\n}\nconst vnode = <div class=\"a\" {...data} />\n```\n\nThe merged data will be:\n\n```js\n{ class: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\n```\n\n### Vue directives\n\nVue directives are usable the same way as in template with a few key differences:\n\n1.  You can use directives camelCased instead of kebab-cased (vMyDirective is treated as `v-my-directive`)\n2.  You have to use underscore sign instead of dots for modifiers because of JSXIdentifier limitation.\n3.  Only runtime directives work (only v-show and custom directives), compile-time directives are out of this project's scope.\n\nA full example would be: `<MyComponent vMyDirective:argument_modifier1_modifier2={someExpression} />`"},{"name":"@vue/babel-preset-jsx","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/jsx/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-jsx","licenseText":"## @vue/babel-preset-jsx\n\nConfigurable preset for Vue JSX plugins.\n\n### Babel Compatibility Notes\n\n- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)\n\n### Usage\n\nInstall the dependencies:\n\n```sh\n# for yarn:\nyarn add @vue/babel-preset-jsx @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props\n# for npm:\nnpm install @vue/babel-preset-jsx @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save\n```\n\nIn your `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"@vue/babel-preset-jsx\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can toggle specific features, by default all features are enabled, e.g.:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\n      \"@vue/babel-preset-jsx\",\n      {\n        \"vModel\": false\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOptions are:\n\n- `functional` [@vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue](../babel-sugar-functional-vue/README.md) - Functional components syntactic sugar\n- `injectH` [@vue/babel-sugar-inject-h](../babel-sugar-inject-h/README.md) - Automatic `h` injection syntactic sugar\n- `vModel` [@vue/babel-sugar-v-model](../babel-sugar-v-model/README.md) - `vModel` syntactic sugar\n- `vOn` [@vue/babel-sugar-v-on](../babel-sugar-v-on/README.md) - `vOn` syntactic sugar"},{"name":"@vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/jsx/tree/master/packages/babel-sugar-functional-vue","licenseText":"## @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue\n\nSyntactic sugar for functional components.\n\n### Babel Compatibility Notes\n\n- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)\n\n### Usage\n\nInstall the dependencies:\n\n```sh\n# for yarn:\nyarn add @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue\n# for npm:\nnpm install @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue --save\n```\n\nIn your `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"@vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.\n\n### Details\n\nThis plugin transpiles arrow functions that return JSX into functional components but only if it's an uppercase variable declaration or default export:\n\n```js\n// Original:\nexport const A = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\nexport const b = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\nexport default ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\n\n// Result:\nexport const A = {\n  functional: true,\n  render: (h, {\n    props,\n    listeners\n  }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\n}\nexport const b = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\nexport default {\n  functional: true,\n  render: (h, {\n    props,\n    listeners\n  }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>\n}\n```"},{"name":"@vue/babel-sugar-inject-h","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/jsx/tree/master/packages/babel-sugar-inject-h","licenseText":"## @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h\n\nSyntactic sugar for automatic `h` inject in JSX.\n\n### Babel Compatibility Notes\n\n- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)\n\n### Usage\n\nInstall the dependencies:\n\n```sh\n# for yarn:\nyarn add @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h\n# for npm:\nnpm install @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h --save\n```\n\nIn your `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"@vue/babel-sugar-inject-h\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.\n\n### Details\n\nThis plugin automatically injects `h` in every method that has JSX.

It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.\n\nThe API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.\n\n## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?\n\nSince this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.\n\nNot listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.\n\n## API\n\n### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor\n\nParse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\n``` ts\ninterface ParseOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename?: string\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options\n  // default: { pad: 'line' }\n  compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions\n  sourceRoot?: string\n  needMap?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface SFCDescriptor {\n  template: SFCBlock | null\n  script: SFCBlock | null\n  styles: SFCBlock[]\n  customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[]\n}\n\ninterface SFCCustomBlock {\n  type: string\n  content: string\n  attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }\n  start: number\n  end: number\n  map?: RawSourceMap\n}\n\ninterface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {\n  lang?: string\n  src?: string\n  scoped?: boolean\n  module?: string | boolean\n}\n```\n\n### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults\n\nTakes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\nIt can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).\n\n``` ts\ninterface TemplateCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options\n  // default: {}\n  compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions\n\n  // Template preprocessor\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n\n  // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls\n  // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is\n  // {\n  //   audio: 'src',\n  //   video: ['src', 'poster'],\n  //   source: 'src',\n  //   img: 'src',\n  //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],\n  //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']\n  // }\n  transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean\n\n  // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble\n  transpileOptions?: any\n\n  isProduction?: boolean  // default: false\n  isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false\n  optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false\n\n  // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)\n  // default: true\n  prettify?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface TemplateCompileResult {\n  ast: Object | undefined\n  code: string\n  source: string\n  tips: string[]\n  errors: string[]\n}\n\ninterface AssetURLOptions {\n  [name: string]: string | string[]\n}\n```\n\n#### Handling the Output\n\nThe resulting JavaScript code will look like this:\n\n``` js\nvar render = function (h) { /* ... */}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}]\n```\n\nIt **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.\n\n### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nTake input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.\n\n``` ts\ninterface StyleCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n  id: string\n  map?: any\n  scoped?: boolean\n  trim?: boolean\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n  postcssOptions?: any\n  postcssPlugins?: any[]\n}\n\ninterface StyleCompileResults {\n  code: string\n  map: any | void\n  rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS\n  errors: string[]\n}\n```\n\n### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nSame as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins."},{"name":"@webassemblyjs/ast","repository":"https://github.com/xtuc/webassemblyjs","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Sven Sauleau <sven@sauleau.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

JSON does not specify a way to encode binary data, so the Node.js implementation of `JSON.stringify` represents buffers as an object of shape `{ type: \"Buffer\", data: [<bytes as numbers>] }`. Unfortunately, `JSON.parse` does not turn this structure back into a `Buffer` object:\n\n```\n$ node\n> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello world') }))\n{ buf:\n   { type: 'Buffer',\n     data: [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ] } }\n```\n\n`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` accept arguments called [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) and [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) respectively which allow customizing the parsing/encoding behavior. This module provides a replacer which encodes Buffer data as a base64-encoded string, and a reviver which turns JSON objects which contain buffer-like data (either as arrays of numbers or strings) into `Buffer` instances. All other types of values are parsed/encoded as normal.\n\n## API\n\n### `stringify(value[, space])`\n\nConvenience wrapper for [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) with the `replacer` described below.\n\n### `parse(text)`\n\nConvenience wrapper for [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) with the `reviver` described below.\n\n### `replacer(key, value)`\n\nA [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) implementation which turns every value that is a `Buffer` instance into an object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: 'base64:<base64-encoded buffer content>' }`. Empty buffers are encoded as `{ type: 'Buffer', data: '' }`.\n\n### `reviver(key, value)`\n\nA [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) implementation which turns every object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: <array of numbers or string> }` into a `Buffer` instance.\n\n## Related modules\n\n- [`buffer-json-encoding`](https://github.com/lachenmayer/buffer-json-encoding): an [`abstract-encoding`](https://github.com/mafintosh/abstract-encoding) compatible JSON encoder/decoder which uses this module.\n\n## License\n\nMIT"},{"name":"buffer-xor","repository":"https://github.com/crypto-browserify/buffer-xor","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Daniel Cousens\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright.

If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola/src/node'\nimport consola from 'consola/src/browser'\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\n\nLog to all reporters.\n\nExample: `consola.info('Message')`\n\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\n\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\n\n- Aliases: `add`\n\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\n\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\n\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\n\nRemove a registered reporter.\n\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\n\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\n\nReplace all reporters.\n\n#### `create(options)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\n\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\n\n#### `withTag(tag)`\n\n- Aliases: `withScope`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\n\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\n\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\n\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\n\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\n\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\n\nWrap both, std and console.\n\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\n\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\n\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\n\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\n\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\n\n#### `mockTypes`\n\n- Aliases: `mock`\n\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\n\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\n```\n\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type.

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  Or without options / local variables:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate')\n  , name = 'swig';\n\ncons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n### Promises\n\n  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\n\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })\n  .then(function (html) {\n    console.log(html);\n  })\n  .catch(function (err) {\n    throw err;\n  });\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.\n When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`\n Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.\n\n## Express 3.x example\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express')\n  , cons = require('consolidate')\n  , app = express();\n\n// assign the swig engine to .html files\napp.engine('html', cons.swig);\n\n// set .html as the default extension\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\n\nvar users = [];\nusers.push({ name: 'tobi' });\nusers.push({ name: 'loki' });\nusers.push({ name: 'jane' });\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.render('index', {\n    title: 'Consolidate.js'\n  });\n});\n\napp.get('/users', function(req, res){\n  res.render('users', {\n    title: 'Users',\n    users: users\n  });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\nconsole.log('Express server listening on port 3000');\n```\n\n## Template Engine Instances\n\nTemplate engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate'),\n  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');\n\n// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be\n// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method\ncons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();\n\ncons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {\n  return 'bar';\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).\n* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`\n* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader\n  with `options.loader`.\n* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.\n* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.\n* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."},{"name":"css-color-names","repository":"https://github.com/bahamas10/css-color-names","licenseText":"css-color-names\n===============\n\nA JSON Object of css color names mapped to their hex value\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n``` js\nvar csscolors = require('css-color-names');\nconsole.dir(csscolors);\n```\n\nyields\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"aqua\": \"#00ffff\",\n  \"aliceblue\": \"#f0f8ff\",\n  \"antiquewhite\": \"#faebd7\",\n  \"black\": \"#000000\",\n  \"blue\": \"#0000ff\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nHow was this list generated?\n----------------------------\n\nIn the Makefile you'll see a line like this:\n\n\t./getcolors.sh | ./stringify.js > $(FILE)\n\nThe first command scrapes a site for the list,\nand outputs the results separated by newlines.

This library provides that functionality, following C behaviour, enabling the writing of algorithms that depend on it. It was designed with performance in mind and tries its best to be as fast as possible. Any improvement is welcome!\n\n\n## How it works\n\nAn unsigned 32 bits integer is represented by an object with its first 16 bits (low bits) and its 16 last ones (high bits). All the supported standard operations on the unsigned integer are then performed transparently.\n\n\te.g.\n\t10000010000100000100010000100010 (2182104098 or 0x82104422) is represented by:\n\thigh=1000001000010000\n\tlow= 0100010000100010\n\nNB.\nIn case of overflow, the unsigned integer is _truncated_ to its lowest 32 bits (in case of UINT32) or 64  bits (in case of UINT64).\n\nThe same applies to 64 bits integers, which are split into 4 16 bits ones.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn nodejs:\n\n    npm install cuint\n\nIn the browser, include the following (file is located in the _build_ directory), and access the constructor with _UINT32_:\n\n`<script src=\"/your/path/to/uint32.js\"></script>\n...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var v1 = UINT32('326648991');\n  var v2 = UINT32('265443576');\n  var v1plus2 = v1.add(v2) // 592092567\n</script>`\n\n## Usage\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 32 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT32 = require('cuint').UINT32 // NodeJS\n\tUINT32( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT32( <number> )\n\tUINT32( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 64 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT64 = require('cuint').UINT64 // NodeJS\n\tUINT64( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <number> )\n\tUINT64( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\n## Important\n\nMost methods __do modify__ the object they are applied to. For instance, the following is equivalent to `x += y`\n\n\tUINT(x).add( UINT(y) )\n\nThis allows for chaining and reduces the cost of the emulation.\nTo have `z = x + y`, do the following:\n\n    z = UINT(x).clone().add( UINT(y) )\n\n## Examples for UINT32\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT32( 2, 1 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT32( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT32( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 44605, _high: 49842 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 32 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' ).div( UINT32( '668265263' ) )`\n> {\tremainder:\n>\t\t\t{\tremainder: null\n>\t\t\t,\t_low: 385\n>\t\t\t,\t_high: 9055\n>\t\t\t}\n>\t,\t_low: 4\n>\t,\t_high: 0\n>\t}\n\n## Examples for UINT64\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1 )\t\t// 4294967298`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 0, _a32: 1, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using first/second low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1, 0, 0 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT64( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT64( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT64( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 44605, _a16: 49842, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 64 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT64( 'F00000000000', 16 ).div( UINT64( '800000000000', 16 ) )`\n> { remainder: \n>   { remainder: null,\n>     _a00: 0,\n>     _a16: 0,\n>     _a32: 28672,\n>     _a48: 0 },\n>  _a00: 1,\n>  _a16: 0,\n>  _a32: 0,\n>  _a48: 0 }\n\n## Methods\n\nMethods specific to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT32.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT32_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with all its low and high bits\n\nMethods common to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT.fromNumber(<number>)*`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a number (first 32 bits only)\n* `UINT.fromString(<string>, <radix>)`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a string\n* `UINT.toNumber()`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a number\n* `UINT.toString(<radix>)`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a string\n* `UINT.add(<uint>)*`\nAdd two _UINT_.

Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

Useful when you need to add something to a tree.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{Object}</i></td>\n    <td>options</td>\n    <td>Options to pass to a `Node` constructor.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Returns\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{Object}</i></td>\n    <td>A new node.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Examples\n\n```js\nlet css = 'a {color: tomato}';\nlet parseTree = gonzales.parse(css);\nlet node = gonzales.createNode({ type: 'animal', content: 'panda' });\nparseTree.content.push(node);\n```\n\n\n### gonzales.parse(css[, options])\n\n##### Description\n\nParses a css string.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{string}</i></td>\n    <td>css</td>\n    <td>A string to parse.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{Object=}</i></td>\n    <td>options</td>\n    <td>Optional. Additional options:\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <code>{string} syntax</code> — any of the following: <code>css</code>,\n          <code>less</code>, <code>sass</code>, <code>scss</code>.\n          Default one is <code>css</code>.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <code>{string} context</code> — root node's type. For a list of available\n          values see <a href=\"docs/node-types.md\">\"Node types\"</a>. Default\n          one is <code>stylesheet</code>.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <code>{number} tabSize</code> — size of a tab character in spaces.\n          Default one is 1.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Returns\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{Object}</i></td>\n    <td>Parse tree.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Examples\n\n```js\nlet css = 'a {color: tomato}';\nlet parseTree = gonzales.parse(css);\n```\n\n```js\nlet less = 'a {$color: tomato}';\nlet parseTree = gonzales.parse(less, {syntax: 'less'});\n```\n\n```js\nlet less = '$color: tomato';\nlet parseTree = gonzales.parse(less, {syntax: 'less', rule: 'declaration'});\n```\n\n### parseTree.contains(type)\n\n##### Description\n\nChecks whether there is a child node of given type.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{string}</i></td>\n    <td>type</td>\n    <td>\n      Node type we're looking for. For a list of available values see\n      <a href=\"docs/node-types.md\">\"Node types\"</a>.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Returns\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{boolean}</i></td>\n    <td>\n      <code>true</code> if a tree contains a child node of a given type,\n      <code>false</code> otherwise.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Examples\n\n```js\nif (parseTree.contains('space')) {\n  doSomething();\n}\n```\n\n### parseTree.content\n\n##### Returns\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{string|Array}</i></td>\n    <td>Node's content (child nodes or a string).</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n### parseTree.eachFor([type, ]callback)\n\n##### Description\n\nCalls a function for every child node in tree. If `type` parameter is passed,\ncalls a function only for child nodes of a given type. The main difference from\n`parseTree.forEach()` is that this method loops through node list from the end\nto beginning.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><i>{string=}</i></td>\n    <td>type</td>\n    <td>\n      Optional.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>"},{"name":"media-typer","repository":"https://github.com/jshttp/media-typer","licenseText":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Douglas Christopher Wilson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."},{"name":"memory-fs","repository":"https://github.com/webpack/memory-fs","licenseText":"Copyright JS Foundation and other contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."},{"name":"memory-fs","repository":"https://github.com/webpack/memory-fs","licenseText":"# memory-fs\r\n\r\nA simple in-memory filesystem.

This works most of the time, but if your build process is environment-agnostic (e.g. if you build a Docker image on CI and use the same image for staging and production), you end up with a result which has the environment baked into it (meaning that in our example, the docker image would be coupled to the environment it was built in).\n\nThis module allows you to read environment variables server side—at runtime—and inject them into your app, meaning your Nuxt bundle is decoupled from your environment variables.\n\n⚠️ **WARNING**: As with the `config.env` option in Nuxt config, environment variables used in `nuxt-env` are exposed client side, so if you store secrets use the `secret` config option. Read more below. ⚠️ \n\n## Usage\n\n`nuxt-env` injects your environment variables into your Nuxt app using `this.$env`.\n\n_**N.B.** If currently use Nuxt's `config.env` option, fear not—`nuxt-env` includes those env vars in the `$env` object._\n\n### Get Setup\n\n1. Install the dependency:\n```bash\nyarn add nuxt-env\n```\n\n2. Add to your `nuxt.config.js` and configure:\n```js\n// nuxt.config.js\n\n// Tell nuxt-env which env vars you want to inject\nmodules: [\n  'other-nuxt-module',\n  ['nuxt-env', {\n    keys: [\n      'TEST_ENV_VAR', // Basic usage—equivalent of { key: 'TEST_ENV_VAR' }\n      { key: 'OTHER_ENV_VAR', default: 'defaultValue' } // Specify a default value\n      { key: 'THIRD_ENV_VAR', secret: true } // Only inject the var server side\n      { key: 'THIRD_ENV_VAR', name: 'MY_ENV_VAR' } // Rename the variable\n    ]\n  }]\n]\n```\n\n#### Options\n\nEnv vars can be injected in a basic way, just by specifying a string in the `keys` option.\nWhen the provided var is an object, it can have the following attributes:\n\n##### `key`\n> required\n\nThe name of the environment variable by which it can be accessed in `process.env`\n\n##### `default`\n\nA default value for the env var in case it's not present in `process.env`.\n\n##### `secret`\n> default: `false`\n\nWhen true, this key will only be present server side.\n\n##### `name`\n\nChange the name of the env var that gets injected. e.g.: `{ key: 'API_URL', name: 'API_ENDPOINT' }` will read `process.env.API_URL` and add it as `$env.API_ENDPOINT`\n\n\n### Use in your application\n\n- Use `this.$env` in your components:\n```js\n// any-component.vue\n\nexport default {\n  computed: {\n    testValue () { return this.$env.TEST_VALUE }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- and in your Nuxt context\n```js\n// any-component.vue\n\nexport default {\n  asyncData ({ app }) {\n    console.log(app.$env.TEST_VALUE)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- and in your store:\n```js\n// store/index.js\n\nexport const mutations = {\n  storeEnv (commit) {\n    const val = this.$env.TEST_VALUE\n    commit('testValue', val)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Develop\n\n```bash\n# Forlk the repo\ngit clone git@github.com:your_username/nuxt-env.git\ncd nuxt-env\nyarn\nyarn test\n\n# To use while developing other apps:\nyarn link\ncd ../my-other-app\nyarn link nuxt-env\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/samtgarson/nuxt-env.

Each node has these properties:\r\n\r\n* `type`: the type of the node (see below);\r\n* `value`: the node's value stripped of trailing whitespaces;\r\n* `sourceIndex`: 0-based index of the node start relative to the source start (excluding trailing whitespaces);\r\n* `before`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node start and the previous node end/source start;\r\n* `after`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node end and the next node start/source end;\r\n* `parent`: a link to this node's parent node (a container).\r\n\r\nA node can have one of these types (according to [the 2012 CSS3 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619/)):\r\n\r\n* `media-query-list`: that is the root level node of the parsing result. A [container](#containers); its children can have types of `url` and `media-query`.\r\n* `url`: if a source is taken from a CSS `@import` rule, it will have a `url(...)` function call. The value of such node will be `url(http://uri-address)`, it is to be parsed separately.\r\n* `media-query`: such nodes correspond to each media query in a comma separated list. In the exapmle above there are two. Nodes of this type are [containers](#containers).\r\n* `media-type`: `screen`, `tv` and other media types.\r\n* `keyword`: `only`, `not` or `and` keyword.\r\n* `media-feature-expression`: an expression in parentheses that checks for a condition of a particular media feature. The value would be like this: `(max-width: 1000px)`. Such nodes are [containers](#containers). They always have a `media-feature` child node, but might not have a `value` child node (like in `screen and (color)`).\r\n* `media-feature`: a media feature, e.g. `max-width`.\r\n* `colon`: present if a media feature expression has a colon (e.g. `(min-width: 1000px)`, compared to `(color)`).\r\n* `value`: a media feature expression value, e.g. `100px` in `(max-width: 1000px)`.\r\n\r\n### Parsing details\r\n\r\npostcss-media-query-parser allows for cases of some **non-standard syntaxes** and tries its best to work them around. For example, in a media query from a code with SCSS syntax:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@media #{$media-type} and ( #{\"max-width\" + \": 10px\"} ) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`#{$media-type}` will be the node of type `media-type`, alghough `$media-type`'s value can be `only screen`. And inside `media-feature-expression` there will only be a `media-feature` type node with the value of `#{\"max-width\" + \": 10px\"}` (this example doesn't make much sense, it's for demo purpose).\r\n\r\nBut the result of parsing **malformed media queries** (such as with incorrect amount of closing parens, curly braces, etc.) can be unexpected. For exapmle, parsing:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@media ((min-width: -100px)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould return a media query list with the single `media-query` node that has no child nodes.\r\n\r\n## Containers\r\n\r\nContainers are [nodes](#nodes) that have other nodes as children. Container nodes have an additional property `nodes` which is an array of their child nodes. And also these methods:\r\n\r\n* `each(callback)` - traverses the direct child nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\r\n* `walk([filter, ]callback)` - traverses ALL descendant nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn both cases `callback` takes these parameters:\r\n\r\n- `node` - the current node (one of the container's descendats, that the callback has been called against).\r\n- `i` - 0-based index of the `node` in an array of its parent's children.\r\n- `nodes` - array of child nodes of `node`'s parent.\r\n\r\nIf `callback` returns `false`, the traversing stops.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT"},{"name":"postcss-merge-longhand","repository":"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano","licenseText":"Copyright (c) Ben Briggs <beneb.info@gmail.com> (http://beneb.info)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."},{"name":"postcss-reduce-initial","repository":"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano","licenseText":"Copyright (c) Ben Briggs <beneb.info@gmail.com> (http://beneb.info)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Usage\n\n###### Common example\n\nThis example lints markdown and turns it into HTML.\n\n```js\nvar remark = require('remark')\nvar recommended = require('remark-preset-lint-recommended')\nvar html = require('remark-html')\nvar report = require('vfile-reporter')\n\nremark()\n  .use(recommended)\n  .use(html)\n  .process('## Hello world!', function(err, file) {\n    console.error(report(err || file))\n    console.log(String(file))\n  })\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```txt\n1:1  warning  Missing newline character at end of file  final-newline  remark-lint\n\n⚠ 1 warning\n```\n\n```html\n<h2>Hello world!</h2>\n```\n\n###### Settings through data\n\nThis example prettifies markdown and configures [`remark-parse`][parse] and\n[`remark-stringify`][stringify] through [data][].\n\n```js\nvar remark = require('remark')\n\nremark()\n  .data('settings', {commonmark: true, emphasis: '*', strong: '*'})\n  .process('_Emphasis_ and __importance__', function(err, file) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    console.log(String(file))\n  })\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```markdown\n*Emphasis* and **importance**\n```\n\n###### Settings through a preset\n\nThis example prettifies markdown and configures [`remark-parse`][parse] and\n[`remark-stringify`][stringify] through a [preset][].\n\n```js\nvar remark = require('remark')\n\nremark()\n  .use({\n    settings: {commonmark: true, emphasis: '*', strong: '*'}\n  })\n  .process('_Emphasis_ and __importance__', function(err, file) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    console.log(String(file))\n  })\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```markdown\n*Emphasis* and

to read markdown as input and process\n[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.\n\n##### `options`\n\nOptions are passed directly, or passed later through [`processor.data()`][data].\n\n##### `options.gfm`\n\n```md\nhello ~~hi~~ world\n```\n\nGFM mode (`boolean`, default: `true`) turns on:\n\n*   [Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks)\n*   [Autolinking of URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#url-autolinking)\n*   [Deletions (strikethrough)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#strikethrough)\n*   [Task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists)\n*   [Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables)\n\n##### `options.commonmark`\n\n```md\nThis is a paragraph\n    and this is also part of the preceding paragraph.\n```\n\nCommonMark mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) allows:\n\n*   Empty lines to split blockquotes\n*   Parentheses (`(` and `)`) around for link and image titles\n*   Any escaped [ASCII-punctuation][escapes] character\n*   Closing parenthesis (`)`) as an ordered list marker\n*   URL definitions (and footnotes, when enabled) in blockquotes\n\nCommonMark mode disallows:\n\n*   Code directly following a paragraph\n*   ATX-headings (`# Hash headings`) without spacing after opening hashes\n    or and before closing hashes\n*   Setext headings (`Underline headings\\n---`) when following a paragraph\n*   Newlines in link and image titles\n*   White space in link and image URLs in auto-links (links in brackets,\n    `<` and `>`)\n*   Lazy blockquote continuation, lines not preceded by a closing angle\n    bracket (`>`), for lists, code, and thematicBreak\n\n##### `options.footnotes`\n\n```md\nSomething something[^or something?].\n\nAnd something else[^1].\n\n[^1]: This reference footnote contains a paragraph...\n\n    * ...and a list\n```\n\nFootnotes mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) enables reference footnotes and\ninline footnotes.  Both are wrapped in square brackets and preceded by a caret\n(`^`), and can be referenced from inside other footnotes.\n\n##### `options.blocks`\n\n```md\n<block>foo\n</block>\n```\n\nBlocks (`Array.<string>`, default: list of [block HTML elements][blocks])\nexposes let’s users define block-level HTML elements.\n\n##### `options.pedantic`\n\n```md\nCheck out some_file_name.txt\n```\n\nPedantic mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) turns on:\n\n*   Emphasis (`_alpha_`) and importance (`__bravo__`) with underscores\n    in words\n*   Unordered lists with different markers (`*`, `-`, `+`)\n*   If `commonmark` is also turned on, ordered lists with different\n    markers (`.`, `)`)\n*   And pedantic mode removes less spaces in list-items (at most four,\n    instead of the whole indent)\n\n### `parse.Parser`\n\nAccess to the [parser][], if you need it.\n\n## Extending the Parser\n\nMost often, using transformers to manipulate a syntax tree produces\nthe desired output.  Sometimes, mainly when introducing new syntactic\nentities with a certain level of precedence, interfacing with the parser\nis necessary.\n\nIf the `remark-parse` plugin is used, it adds a [`Parser`][parser] constructor\nto the `processor`.  Other plugins can add tokenizers to the parser’s prototype\nto change how markdown is parsed.\n\nThe below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = mentions\n\nfunction mentions() {\n  var Parser = this.Parser\n  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers\n  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods\n\n  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).\n  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention\n\n  // Run it just before `text`.\n  methods.splice(methods.indexOf('text'), 0, 'mention')\n}\n```\n\n### `Parser#blockTokenizers`\n\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These\ntokenizers (for example: `fencedCode`, `table`, and `paragraph`) eat\nfrom the start of a value to a line ending.\n\nSee `#blockMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\ndefault.\n\n### `Parser#blockMethods`\n\nArray of `blockTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\nwhich they run.\n\n<!--methods-block start-->\n\n*   `newline`\n*   `indentedCode`\n*   `fencedCode`\n*   `blockquote`\n*   `atxHeading`\n*   `thematicBreak`\n*   `list`\n*   `setextHeading`\n*   `html`\n*   `footnote`\n*   `definition`\n*   `table`\n*   `paragraph`\n\n<!--methods-block end-->\n\n### `Parser#inlineTokenizers`\n\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These tokenizers\n(for example: `url`, `reference`, and `emphasis`) eat from the start\nof a value.  To increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.\n\nSee `#inlineMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\ndefault.\n\n### `Parser#inlineMethods`\n\nArray of `inlineTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\nwhich they run.\n\n<!--methods-inline start-->\n\n*   `escape`\n*   `autoLink`\n*   `url`\n*   `html`\n*   `link`\n*   `reference`\n*   `strong`\n*   `emphasis`\n*   `deletion`\n*   `code`\n*   `break`\n*   `text`\n\n<!--methods-inline end-->\n\n### `function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\n```js\ntokenizeMention.notInLink = true\ntokenizeMention.locator = locateMention\n\nfunction tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {\n  var match = /^@(\\w+)/.exec(value)\n\n  if (match) {\n    if (silent) {\n      return true\n    }\n\n    return eat(match[0])({\n      type: 'link',\n      url: 'https://social-network/' + match[1],\n      children: [{type: 'text', value: match[0]}]\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe parser knows two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.\nBlock level tokenizers are the same as inline level tokenizers, with\nthe exception that the latter must have a [locator][].\n\nTokenizers _test_ whether a document starts with a certain syntactic\nentity.  In _silent_ mode, they return whether that test passes.\nIn _normal_ mode, they consume that token, a process which is called\n“eating”.  Locators enable tokenizers to function faster by providing\ninformation on where the next entity may occur.\n\n###### Signatures\n\n*   `Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)`\n*   `boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `eat` ([`Function`][eat]) — Eat, when applicable, an entity\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may start an entity\n*   `silent` (`boolean`, optional) — Whether to detect or consume\n\n###### Properties\n\n*   `locator` ([`Function`][locator])\n    — Required for inline tokenizers\n*   `onlyAtStart` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning of the document\n*   `notInBlock` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in blockquotes, lists, or footnote\n    definitions\n*   `notInList` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in lists\n*   `notInLink` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in links\n\n###### Returns\n\n*   In _silent_ mode, whether a node can be found at the start of `value`\n*   In _normal_ mode, a node if it can be found at the start of `value`\n\n### `tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)`\n\n```js\nfunction locateMention(value, fromIndex) {\n  return value.indexOf('@', fromIndex)\n}\n```\n\nLocators are required for inline tokenization to keep the process\nperformant.  Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by\nproviding information on the where the next entity occurs.  Locators\nmay be wrong, it’s OK if there actually isn’t a node to be found at\nthe index they return, but they must skip any nodes.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may contain an entity\n*   `fromIndex` (`number`) — Position to start searching at\n\n###### Returns\n\nIndex at which an entity may start, and `-1` otherwise.\n\n### `eat(subvalue)`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n```\n\nEat `subvalue`, which is a string at the start of the\n[tokenize][tokenizer]d `value` (it’s tracked to ensure the correct\nvalue is eaten).\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `subvalue` (`string`) - Value to eat.\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`add`][add].\n\n### `add(node[, parent])`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n\nadd({type: 'text', value: 'foo'})\n```\n\nAdd [positional information][location] to `node` and add it to `parent`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\nThe given `node`.\n\n### `add.test()`\n\nGet the [positional information][location] which would be patched on\n`node` by `add`.\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`Location`][location].\n\n### `add.reset(node[, parent])`\n\n`add`, but resets the internal location.  Useful for example in\nlists, where the same content is first eaten for a list, and later\nfor list items\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\nThe given `node`.\n\n### Turning off a tokenizer\n\nIn rare situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing\nthat syntactic feature.  This can be done by replacing the tokenizer from\nyour Parser’s `blockTokenizers` (or `blockMethods`) or `inlineTokenizers`\n(or `inlineMethods`).\n\nThe following example turns off indented code blocks:\n\n```js\nremarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode\n\nfunction indentedCode() {\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nPreferably, just use [this plugin](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/tree/master/packages/remark-disable-tokenizers).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n<!-- Definitions -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark/master.svg\n\n[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark\n\n[coverage-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/remarkjs/remark.svg\n\n[coverage-status]: https://codecov.io/github/remarkjs/remark\n\n[dl-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/remark-parse.svg\n\n[dl]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-parse\n\n[size-badge]: https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/remark-parse.svg\n\n[size]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=remark-parse\n\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/join%20the%20community-on%20spectrum-7b16ff.svg\n\n[chat]: https://spectrum.chat/unified/remark\n\n[license]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/license\n\n[author]: https://wooorm.com\n\n[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\n\n[unified]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified\n\n[data]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processordatakey-value\n\n[processor]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark\n\n[mdast]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\n\n[escapes]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#backslash-escapes\n\n[node]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#node\n\n[location]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#location\n\n[parser]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processorparser\n\n[extend]: #extending-the-parser\n\n[tokenizer]: #function-tokenizereat-value-silent\n\n[locator]: #tokenizerlocatorvalue-fromindex\n\n[eat]: #eatsubvalue\n\n[add]: #addnode-parent\n\n[blocks]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark-parse/lib/block-elements.js\n\n[announcement]: https://medium.com/unifiedjs/collectively-evolving-through-crowdsourcing-22c359ea95cc"},{"name":"remark-stringify","repository":"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify","licenseText":"# remark-stringify [![Travis][build-badge]][build-status] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage-status] [![Downloads][dl-badge]][dl] [![Size][size-badge]][size] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]\n\n[Compiler][] for [**unified**][unified].\nStringifies [**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees to markdown.\nUsed in the [**remark** processor][processor] but can be used on its own as\nwell.\nCan be [extended][extend] to change how markdown is parsed.\n\n* * *\n\n**Announcing the unified collective!

Other plugins can change and add visitors on\nthe compiler’s prototype to change how markdown is stringified.\n\nThe below plugin modifies a [visitor][] to add an extra blank line\nbefore level two headings.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = gap\n\nfunction gap() {\n  var Compiler = this.Compiler\n  var visitors = Compiler.prototype.visitors\n  var original = visitors.heading\n\n  visitors.heading = heading\n\n  function heading(node) {\n    return (node.depth === 2 ? '\\n' : '') + original.apply(this, arguments)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `Compiler#visitors`\n\nAn object mapping [node][] types to [`visitor`][visitor]s.\n\n### `function visitor(node[, parent])`\n\nStringify `node`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) — Node to compile\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) — Parent of `node`\n\n###### Returns\n\n`string`, the compiled given `node`.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n<!-- Definitions -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark/master.svg\n\n[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark\n\n[coverage-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/remarkjs/remark.svg\n\n[coverage-status]: https://codecov.io/github/remarkjs/remark\n\n[dl-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/remark-stringify.svg\n\n[dl]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-stringify\n\n[size-badge]: https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/remark-stringify.svg\n\n[size]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=remark-stringify\n\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/join%20the%20community-on%20spectrum-7b16ff.svg\n\n[chat]: https://spectrum.chat/unified/remark\n\n[license]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/license\n\n[author]: https://wooorm.com\n\n[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\n\n[unified]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified\n\n[processor]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark\n\n[data]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processordatakey-value\n\n[compiler]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processorcompiler\n\n[mdast]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\n\n[node]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#node\n\n[extend]: #extending-the-compiler\n\n[visitor]: #function-visitornode-parent\n\n[markdown-table]: https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-table\n\n[string-length]: https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-table#stringlengthcell\n\n[announcement]: https://medium.com/unifiedjs/collectively-evolving-through-crowdsourcing-22c359ea95cc"},{"name":"remove-trailing-separator","repository":"https://github.com/darsain/remove-trailing-separator","licenseText":"Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

Each priority level must finish entirely before the\nnext priority level is run.  See\n[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is\neven true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue\ncan execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:\n\n```\n[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### const queue = new RunQueue(options)\n\nCreate a new queue. Options may contain:\n\n* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.\n* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.\n\n### queue.add (prio, fn, args)\n\nAdd a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`\nwith `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.\n\n### queue.run ()\n\nStart running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either\nall the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a\nrejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected\nwith that error and no further queue running will be done.\n\n## PRIORITIES\n\nPriorities are any integer value >= 0.\n\nLowest is executed first.\n\nPriorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue\nmust complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.\n\nThis means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`\nmust complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs\nwhile `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`\nqueue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs\ncomplete."},{"name":"rxjs","repository":"https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs","licenseText":"Apache License\n                         Version 2.0, January 2004\n                      http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n 1.

The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).\n\n## API\n\n### Parsing\n\n\tURI.parse(\"uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  scheme : \"uri\",\n\t//  userinfo : \"user:pass\",\n\t//  host : \"example.com\",\n\t//  port : 123,\n\t//  path : \"/one/two.three\",\n\t//  query : \"q1=a1&q2=a2\",\n\t//  fragment : \"body\"\n\t//}\n\n### Serializing\n\n\tURI.serialize({scheme : \"http\", host : \"example.com\", fragment : \"footer\"}) === \"http://example.com/#footer\"\n\n### Resolving\n\n\tURI.resolve(\"uri://a/b/c/d?q\", \"../../g\") === \"uri://a/g\"\n\n### Normalizing\n\n\tURI.normalize(\"HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html\") === \"http://abc.com/~smith/home.html\"\n\n### Comparison\n\n\tURI.equal(\"example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D\", \"eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d\") === true\n\n### IP Support\n\n\t//IPv4 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//192.068.001.000\") === \"//192.68.1.0\"\n\n\t//IPv6 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]\") === \"//[2001:0:db8::1]\"\n\n\t//IPv6 zone identifier support\n\tURI.parse(\"//[2001:db8::7%25en1]\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  host : \"2001:db8::7%en1\"\n\t//}\n\n### IRI Support\n\n\t//convert IRI to URI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://examplé.org/rosé\")) === \"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"\n\t//convert URI to IRI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"), {iri:true}) === \"http://examplé.org/rosé\"\n\n### Options\n\nAll of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:\n\n*\t`scheme` (string)\n\n\tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.\n\n*\t`reference` (string)\n\n\tIf set to `\"suffix\"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.\n\n*\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.\n\n*\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.\n\n*\t`iri` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).\n\n## Scheme Extendable\n\nURI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

You need to include a [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) to make it work on incompatible browsers.**\n\n## Import\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport VueObserveVisibility from 'vue-observe-visibility'\n\nVue.use(VueObserveVisibility)\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { ObserveVisibility } from 'vue-observe-visibility'\n\nVue.directive('observe-visibility', ObserveVisibility)\n```\n\n## Browser\n\n```html\n<script src=\"vue.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"vue-observe-visibility/dist/vue-observe-visibility.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe plugin should be auto-installed. If not, you can install it manually with the instructions below.\n\nInstall all the directives:\n\n```javascript\nVue.use(VueObserveVisibility)\n```\n\nUse specific directives:\n\n```javascript\nVue.directive('observe-visibility', VueObserveVisibility.ObserveVisibility)\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nThe `v-observe-visibility` directive is very easy to use. Just pass a function as the value:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\">\n```\n\nThis also works on components:\n\n```html\n<MyComponent v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\" />\n```\n\nThe function will be called whenever the visiblity of the element changes with the argument being a boolean (`true` means the element is visible on the page, `false` means that it is not).\n\nThe second argument is the corresponding [IntersectionObserverEntry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry) object.\n\n```javascript\nvisibilityChanged (isVisible, entry) {\n  this.isVisible = isVisible\n  console.log(entry)\n}\n```\n\n## IntersectionObserver options\n\nIt's possible to pass the [IntersectionObserver `options` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver#Parameters) using the `intersection` attribute:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  intersection: {\n    root: ...,\n    rootMargin: ...,\n    threshold: 0.3,\n  },\n}\">\n```\n\n## Once\n\nIt can be useful to listen for when the element is visible only once, for example to build introduction animations. Set the `once` option to `true`:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  once: true,\n}\">\n```\n\n## Throttling visibility\n\nYou can use the `throttle` options (in ms) specifying minimal state duration after which an event will be fired. It's useful when you are tracking visibility while scrolling and don't want events from fastly scrolled out elements.\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  throttle: 300,\n}\">\n```\n\n## Passing custom arguments\n\nYou can add custom argument by using an intermediate function:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"(isVisible, entry) => visibilityChanged(isVisible, entry, customArgument)\">\n```\n\nHere `visibilityChanged` will be call with a third custom argument `customArgument`.\n\n## Disabling the observer\n\nPassing a falsy value to the directive will disable the observer:\n\n```html\n<div\n  v-for=\"(item, index) of items\"\n  :key=\"item.id\"\n  v-observe-visibility=\"index === items.length - 1 ? visibilityChanged : false\"\n>\n```\n\n# Example\n\n```html\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <button @click=\"show = !show\">Toggle</button>\n  <label>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"isVisible\" disabled/> Is visible?\n  </label>\n  <div ref=\"test\" v-show=\"show\" v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\">Hello world!</div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    show: true,\n    isVisible: true,\n  },\n  methods: {\n    visibilityChanged (isVisible, entry) {\n      this.isVisible = isVisible\n      console.log(entry)\n    },\n  },\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)"},{"name":"vue-router","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-present Evan You\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For pull requests please see [src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js).\n\nThis package can be used to pre-compile Vue 2.0 templates into render functions to avoid runtime-compilation overhead and CSP restrictions. In most cases you should be using it with [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader), you will only need it separately if you are writing build tools with very specific needs.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install vue-template-compiler\n```\n\n``` js\nconst compiler = require('vue-template-compiler')\n```\n\n## API\n\n### compiler.compile(template, [options])\n\nCompiles a template string and returns compiled JavaScript code. The returned result is an object of the following format:\n\n``` js\n{\n  ast: ?ASTElement, // parsed template elements to AST\n  render: string, // main render function code\n  staticRenderFns: Array<string>, // render code for static sub trees, if any\n  errors: Array<string> // template syntax errors, if any\n}\n```\n\nNote the returned function code uses `with` and thus cannot be used in strict mode code.\n\n#### Options\n\n- `outputSourceRange` *new in 2.6*\n  - Type: `boolean`\n  - Default: `false`\n\n  Set this to true will cause the `errors` returned in the compiled result become objects in the form of `{ msg, start, end }`. The `start` and `end` properties are numbers that mark the code range of the error source in the template. This can be passed on to the `compiler.generateCodeFrame` API to generate a code frame for the error.\n\n- `whitespace`\n  - Type: `string`\n  - Valid values: `'preserve' | 'condense'`\n  - Default: `'preserve'`\n\n  The default value `'preserve'` handles whitespaces as follows:\n\n  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is condensed into a single space.\n  - All other whitespaces are preserved as-is.\n\n  If set to `'condense'`:\n\n  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is removed if it contains new lines. Otherwise, it is condensed into a single space.\n  - Consecutive whitespaces inside a non-whitespace-only text node are condensed into a single space.\n\n  Using condense mode will result in smaller compiled code size and slightly improved performance. However, it will produce minor visual layout differences compared to plain HTML in certain cases.\n\n  **This option does not affect the `<pre>` tag.**\n\n  Example:\n\n  ``` html\n  <!-- source -->\n  <div>\n    <span>\n      foo\n    </span>   <span>bar</span>\n  </div>\n\n  <!-- whitespace: 'preserve' -->\n  <div> <span>\n    foo\n    </span> <span>bar</span> </div>\n\n  <!-- whitespace: 'condense' -->\n  <div><span> foo </span> <span>bar</span></div>\n  ```\n\n- `modules`\n\n  It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-loader` and `vueify`.**\n\n  An array of compiler modules. For details on compiler modules, refer to the `ModuleOptions` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js#L47-L59) and the [built-in modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules).\n\n- `directives`\n\n  An object where the key is the directive name and the value is a function that transforms an template AST node. For example:\n\n  ``` js\n  compiler.compile('<div v-test></div>', {\n    directives: {\n      test (node, directiveMeta) {\n        // transform node based on directiveMeta\n      }\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  By default, a compile-time directive will extract the directive and the directive will not be present at runtime. If you want the directive to also be handled by a runtime definition, return `true` in the transform function.\n\n  Refer to the implementation of some [built-in compile-time directives](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/directives).\n\n- `preserveWhitespace` **Deprecated since 2.6**\n  - Type: `boolean`\n  - Default: `true`\n\n  By default, the compiled render function preserves all whitespace characters between HTML tags. If set to `false`, whitespace between tags will be ignored. This can result in slightly better performance but may affect layout for inline elements.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.compileToFunctions(template)\n\nSimilar to `compiler.compile`, but directly returns instantiated functions:\n\n``` js\n{\n  render: Function,\n  staticRenderFns: Array<Function>\n}\n```\n\nThis is only useful at runtime with pre-configured builds, so it doesn't accept any compile-time options. In addition, this method uses `new Function()` so it is not CSP-compliant.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.ssrCompile(template, [options])\n\n> 2.4.0+\n\nSame as `compiler.compile` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.\n\nThis is used by default in `vue-loader@>=12` and can be disabled using the [`optimizeSSR`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#optimizessr) option.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.ssrCompileToFunctions(template)\n\n> 2.4.0+\n\nSame as `compiler.compileToFunction` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.parseComponent(file, [options])\n\nParse a SFC (single-file component, or `*.vue` file) into a descriptor (refer to the `SFCDescriptor` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js)). This is used in SFC build tools like `vue-loader` and `vueify`.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.generateCodeFrame(template, start, end)\n\nGenerate a code frame that highlights the part in `template` defined by `start` and `end`. Useful for error reporting in higher-level tooling.\n\n#### Options\n\n#### `pad`\n\n`pad` is useful when you are piping the extracted content into other pre-processors, as you will get correct line numbers or character indices if there are any syntax errors.\n\n- with `{ pad: \"line\" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one newline for each line in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the line numbers align with the original file.\n- with `{ pad: \"space\" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one space for each character in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the character count remains the same as the original file."},{"name":"vue-template-es2015-compiler","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-template-es2015-compiler","licenseText":"This is an internal package used by `vue-loader` and `vueify`. It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:\n\n1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).\n\n**Note:** since version 1.8.0, object rest spread usage inside templates are transpiled to `Object.assign` calls by default. This means if you need to support IE, you will need to polyfill `Object.assign`. (Latest version of Vue CLI will do this for you).\n\n2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.\n\nThe buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble"},{"name":"vuex","repository":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-present Evan You\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
